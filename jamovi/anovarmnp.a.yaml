        The Friedman test is used to explore the relationship between a
        continuous dependent variable and a categorical explanatory variable,
        where the explanatory variable is 'within subjects' (where multiple
        measurements are from the same subject). It is analagous to Repeated
        Measures ANOVA, but with the advantage of being non-parametric, and not
        requiring the assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances.
        However, it has the limitation that it can only test a single
        explanatory variable at a time.
