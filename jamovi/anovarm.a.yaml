        The Repeated Measures ANOVA is used to explore the relationship
        between a continuous dependent variable and one or more categorical
        explanatory variables, where one or more of the explanatory variables
        are 'within subjects' (where multiple measurements are from the same
        subject). Additionally, this analysis allows the inclusion of
        covariates, allowing for repeated measures ANCOVAs as well.

        This analysis requires that the data be in 'wide format', where each
        row represents a subject (as opposed to long format, where each
        measurement of the dependent variable is represented as a row).

        A non-parametric equivalent of the repeated measures ANOVA also exists;
        the Friedman test. However, it has the limitation of only being able to
        test a single factor.
