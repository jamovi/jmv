        The Student's paired samples t-test (sometimes called a
        dependent-samples t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that the
        difference between pairs of measurements is equal to zero. A low p-value
        suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and that the
        difference between the measurement pairs is not zero.

        The Student's paired samples t-test assumes that pair differences follow
        a normal distribution -- in the case that one is unwilling to assume
        this, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank can be used in it's place
        (However, note that the Wilcoxon signed-rank has a slightly different
        null hypothesis; that the two groups of measurements follow the same
        distribution).
