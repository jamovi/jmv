        The Student's One-sample t-test is used to test the null hypothesis that
        the true mean is equal to a particular value (typically zero). A low
        p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and therefore
        the true mean must be different from the test value.

        The Student's One-sample t-test assumes that the data are from a normal
        distribution -- in the case that one is unwilling to assume this, the
        non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank can be used in it's place (However,
        note that the Wilcoxon signed-rank has a slightly different null
        hypothesis; that the *median* is equal to the test value).
