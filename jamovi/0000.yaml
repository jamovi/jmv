  This module represents the analyses included with jamovi. It contains many
  common analyses (such as t-tests, ANOVAs, regression, correlation matrices,
  proportion tests, contingency tables, factor analysis, etc).
analyses:
  - title: Descriptives
    name: descriptives
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Exploration
    menuTitle: Descriptives
    description: >
      Descriptives are an assortment of summarising statistics, and
      visualizations which allow exploring the shape and distribution of data.
      It is good practice to explore your data with descriptives before
      proceeding to more formal tests.
  - title: Independent Samples T-Test
    name: ttestIS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Independent Samples T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's Independent samples t-test (sometimes called a two-samples
      t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the
      same mean. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true,
      and therefore the group means are different.
  - title: Paired Samples T-Test
    name: ttestPS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: Paired Samples T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's paired samples t-test (sometimes called a
      dependent-samples t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that the
      difference between pairs of measurements is equal to zero. A low p-value
      suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and that the
      difference between the measurement pairs is not zero.
  - title: One Sample T-Test
    name: ttestOneS
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: T-Tests
    menuTitle: One Sample T-Test
    description: |-
      The Student's One-sample t-test is used to test the null hypothesis that
      the true mean is equal to a particular value (typically zero). A low
      p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true, and therefore
      the true mean must be different from the test value.
  - title: One-Way ANOVA
    name: anovaOneW
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: One-Way ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
      the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor, however
      also providing a Welch's ANOVA. The Welch's ANOVA has the advantage that
      it need not assume that the variances of all groups are equal.
  - title: ANOVA
    name: anova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables.
  - title: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    name: anovaRM
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Repeated Measures ANOVA is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables, where one or more of the explanatory variables
      are 'within subjects' (where multiple measurements are from the same
      subject). Additionally, this analysis allows the inclusion of
      covariates, allowing for repeated measures ANCOVAs as well.
  - title: ANCOVA
    name: ancova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: ANCOVA
    description: |
      The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, one or more categorical
      explanatory variables, and one or more continuous explanatory variables
      (or covariates). It is essentially the same analysis as ANOVA, but
      with the addition of covariates.
  - title: MANCOVA
    name: mancova
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuTitle: MANCOVA
    description: >
      Multivariate Analysis of (Co)Variance (MANCOVA) is used to explore the
      relationship between multiple dependent variables, and one or more
      categorical and/or continuous explanatory variables.
  - title: One-Way ANOVA (Non-parametric)
    name: anovaNP
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuSubgroup: Non-Parametric
    menuTitle: One-Way ANOVA
    menuSubtitle: Kruskal-Wallis
    description: >
      The Kruskal-Wallis test is used to explore the relationship between a
      continuous dependent variable, and a categorical explanatory variable. It
      is analagous to ANOVA, but with the advantage of being non-parametric and
      having fewer assumptions. However, it has the limitation that it can only
      test a single explanatory variable at a time.
  - title: Repeated Measures ANOVA (Non-parametric)
    name: anovaRMNP
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: ANOVA
    menuSubgroup: Non-Parametric
    menuTitle: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    menuSubtitle: Friedman
    description: >
      The Friedman test is used to explore the relationship between a continuous
      dependent variable and a categorical explanatory variable, where the
      explanatory variable is 'within subjects' (where multiple measurements are
      from the same subject). It is analagous to Repeated Measures ANOVA, but
      with the advantage of being non-parametric, and not requiring the
      assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances. However, it has the
      limitation that it can only test a single explanatory variable at a time.
  - title: Correlation Matrix
    name: corrMatrix
    menuGroup: Regression
    menuTitle: Correlation Matrix
    ns: jmv
    description: |-
      Correlation matrices are a way to examine linear relationships between
      two or more continuous variables.
  - title: Partial Correlation
    name: corrPart
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Regression
    menuTitle: Partial Correlation
    description: |-
      Partial correlation matrices are a way to examine linear relationships
      between two or more continuous variables while controlling for other
      variables
  - title: Linear Regression
    name: linReg
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Regression
    menuTitle: Linear Regression
    description: >
      Linear regression is used to explore the relationship between a continuous
      dependent variable, and one or more continuous and/or categorical
      explanatory variables. Other statistical methods, such as ANOVA and
      ANCOVA, are in reality just forms of linear regression.
  - title: Binomial Logistic Regression

    menuSubgroup: Logistic Regression
    menuTitle: 2 Outcomes

  - title: Proportion Test (2 Outcomes)
    name: propTest2
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Frequencies
    menuSubgroup: One Sample Proportion Tests
    menuTitle: 2 Outcomes
    menuSubtitle: Binomial test
    description: >
      The Binomial test is used to test the Null hypothesis that the proportion
      of observations match some expected value. If the p-value is low, this
      suggests that the Null hypothesis is false, and that the true proportion
      must be some other value.
  - title: Proportion Test (N Outcomes)
    name: propTestN
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Frequencies
    menuSubgroup: One Sample Proportion Tests
    menuTitle: N Outcomes
    menuSubtitle: χ² Goodness of fit
    description: >
      The χ² Goodness of fit test (not to be confused with the χ² test of
      independence), tests the Null hypothesis that the proportions of
      observations match some expected proportions. If the p-value is low, this
      suggests that the Null hypothesis is false, and that the true proportions
      are different to those tested.
  - title: Contingency Tables
    name: contTables
    ns: jmv
    menuGroup: Frequencies
    menuSubgroup: Contingency Tables
    menuTitle: Independent Samples
    menuSubtitle: χ² test of association
    description: >
      The χ² test of association (not to be confused with the χ² goodness of
      fit) is used to test whether two categorical variables are independent or
      associated. If the p-value is low, it suggests the variables are not
      independent, and that there is a relationship between the two variables.
